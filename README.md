## 🚀 A series of practical projects inspired by the idea to take the same sample NodeJS web application and juggle it applying diverse DevOps technologies:

This two-tier web application interfaces with a MySQL database, facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database records.

**<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Detailed app description</summary>**

## Summary

The app sets up a web server for a supplier management system. It allows viewing, adding, updating, and deleting suppliers. 

#### **Dependencies and Modules**:
   - **express**: The framework that allows us to set up and run a web server.
   - **body-parser**: A tool that lets the server read and understand data sent in requests.
   - **cors**: Ensures the server can communicate with different web addresses or domains.
   - **mustache-express**: A template engine, letting the server display dynamic web pages using the Mustache format.
   - **serve-favicon**: Provides the small icon seen on browser tabs for the website.
   - **Custom Modules**: 
     - `supplier.controller`: Handles the logic for managing suppliers like fetching, adding, or updating their details.
     - `config.js`: Keeps the server's settings for connectind to the MySQL database.

#### **Configuration**:
   - The server starts on a port taken from a setting (like an environment variable) or uses `3000` as a default.

#### **Middleware**:
   - It's equipped to understand data in JSON format or when it's URL-encoded.
   - It can chat with web pages hosted elsewhere, thanks to CORS.
   - Mustache is the chosen format for web pages, with templates stored in a folder named `views`.
   - There's a public storage (`public`) for things like images or stylesheets, accessible by anyone visiting the site.
   - The site's tiny browser tab icon is fetched using `serve-favicon`.

#### **Routes (Webpage Endpoints)**:
   - **Home**: `GET /`: Serves the home page.
   - **Supplier Operations**: 
     - `GET /suppliers/`: Fetches and displays all suppliers.
     - `GET /supplier-add`: Serves a page to add a new supplier.
     - `POST /supplier-add`: Receives data to add a new supplier.
     - `GET /supplier-update/:id`: Serves a page to update details of a supplier using its ID.
     - `POST /supplier-update`: Receives updated data of a supplier.
     - `POST /supplier-remove/:id`: Removes a supplier using its ID.

#### **Starting Up**:
   - The server comes to life, starts listening for visits, and announces its awakening with a log message.
